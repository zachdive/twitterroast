# API Route Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
- **Problem**: API route not found error in the Twitter Roaster application
- **Environment**: Next.js application deployed on Netlify
- **Impact**: Users unable to generate roasts due to non-functional API endpoint

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Static Site Generation (SSG) Configuration**:
   - Next.js configured with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`
   - This setting disables API routes, requiring server-side processing

2. **Netlify Deployment Mismatch**:
   - Netlify expected a fully static site
   - API routes not properly handled in the production environment

## Resolution Steps
1. **Implement Netlify Functions**:
   - Created `netlify/functions/api.js` to handle server-side processing
   - Allows API-like functionality in a static site deployment

2. **API Route Migration**:
   - Moved API logic from `src/app/api/roast/route.ts` to `netlify/functions/api.js`
   - Ensures server-side execution on Netlify

3. **Next.js Configuration Update**:
   - Updated `next.config.js`:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       output: 'export',
       images: { unoptimized: true },
       trailingSlash: true,
     };
     ```
   - Optimizes build for static site generation
   - Ensures compatibility with new API setup

4. **Build Script Modification**:
   - Updated `package.json` build script:
     ```json
     "build": "next build && cp -r netlify/functions out/"
     ```
   - Includes Netlify functions in the build output

5. **Frontend Code Update**:
   - Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to call the new Netlify Function endpoint
   - Replaced calls to Next.js API route with Netlify Function URL

6. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implemented robust error handling in Netlify Function
   - Added detailed logging for improved debugging

7. **Redeployment**:
   - Redeployed the application to Netlify
   - Ensured correct deployment of both static frontend and Netlify Function

## Lessons Learned
1. Always consider the deployment environment when configuring Next.js applications
2. Netlify Functions provide a powerful alternative for server-side processing in static sites
3. Proper error handling and logging are crucial for quick issue resolution in production

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor API performance and scale Netlify Functions as needed
2. Consider implementing automated tests for API functionality
3. Regularly review and update documentation to reflect any changes in the application architecture
